# Auto MLP CCG for OCTGN

The Auto MLP CCG mod for [OCTGN](http://www.octgn.net/Home/GetOctgn) is designed to bring the MLP CCG to a digital, multiplayer platform, utilising a powerful scripting framework to automate the game actions and effects, freeing the player up to focus solely on the gameplay without having to worry about maintaining the game state manually.

## Installation

As the mod is currently in an un-released state, there is no central repository from which install the mod from within OCTGN and only those wishing to get involved in the development of the mod should use git to install the mod.

1. Navigate to your OCTGN/GameDatabase folder (normally "My Documents/OCTGN/GameDatabase") using git command line or git for windows.
2. Clone the repository to a new folder.
3. Rename the folder to "a953003d-3075-4b56-8f6f-1122b7fa94bd"
4. OPTIONAL: Create a new shortcut to OCTGN and add these command line switches "/x CLV /table /game=a953003d-3075-4b56-8f6f-1122b7fa94bd"

You should now be able to run OCTGN and see the Auto MLP CCG mod show up in your games list. I highly recommend setting images using the deck builder, at least until we get proxy gen done.
